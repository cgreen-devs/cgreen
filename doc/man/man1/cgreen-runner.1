.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Cgreen
is a framework for creating and running compact and easy-to-read
unittests for C and/or C++. After compiling your tests and linking
them together with the code/class/subject under test (CUT/SUT) into a
shared dynamically loadable \fILIBRARY\fR you can auto-discover and
run all tests using the
.B cgreen-runner
without having to manually add each and every test that you write to a
suite programmatically.
.PP
This makes the TDD cycle even faster and less error-prone, one less thing to remember.


.SS "Usage:"
Discover and run all, or a single named, cgreen test(s) from one or multiple
dynamically loadable library.
.PP
A single test can be run using the form [<context>:]<name> where <context> can
be omitted if there is no context.
