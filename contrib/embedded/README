CGreen can now be built (and even work) in the embedded environments including
microcontrollers (aka MCU)

Building is very easy (for STM32 MCUs):
	cmake -DSTM32_CHIP=stm32f103c8 \
	-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/path/to/stm32-cmake/cmake/gcc_stm32.cmake \
	-DCMAKE_MODULE_PATH=/path/to/stm32-cmake/cmake \
	-DTOOLCHAIN_PREFIX=/path/to/arm_gcc_with_newlib \
	/path/to/cgreen/ && make

That wont build all of CGreen but libcgreen.a is enough.
