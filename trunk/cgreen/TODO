TODO for Cgreen
===============

Unit tester
-----------
Can compare doubles
    - need to allow significant figues as well as decimal places.
Move non-visible files into src/ directory - done.

Mocks
-----
Sort out counting glitches, especially in expect_never().
Unfulfilled expectations should send a failure.
Add expect_call_count().

Suites
------

Collector
---------
Should write back to the same file when given a single file parameter, stdout otherwise.
Fix bug in slurp.c file.

Packages
--------
Write script for building tarball.
    - HTML docs must be pre-built (no docbook dependency for users).
    - Need to build preprocessor tool once finished.
Make sure only the public symbols are exported in the library.
Users should just be able to go "#include <cgreen.h>".

Documentation
-------------
Add tests for examples.
Add collector behaviour and Ensure macro to docs.
Add install section
Fix margin size in pdf docs
