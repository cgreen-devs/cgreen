TODO for Cgreen
===============

Unit tester
-----------
Needs to work will all standard C99 types:
    - needs to work with "long long"
    - needs to work with "unsigned long long"
    - needs to work with "short"
    - needs to work with "char"
    - needs to work with "long double"

Mocks
-----
Sort out counting glitches, especially in expect_never().
Unfulfilled expectations should send a failure.
Add expect_call_count().

Suites
------
Exceptions, as well as failures, should cause a bad exit code.

Collector
---------
Should write back to the same file when given a single file parameter, stdout otherwise.
Fix memory bug in slurp.c file.

Packages
--------
Write script for building tarball.
    - Need to build collector tool (once it's finished).
Make sure only the public symbols are exported in the library.

Documentation
-------------
Add tests for examples.
Add collector behaviour (once finished) and Ensure macro to docs.
