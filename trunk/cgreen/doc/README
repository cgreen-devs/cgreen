HOW-TO:  Compiling the Cgreen Guide
======================================

The Cgreen Guide Book is written using Asciidoc tool. Asciidoc is a
wonderful way to write textual docs using Docbook as backend. Please
visit http://www.asciidoc.org for more information.

You also need source-highlight (http://www.gnu.org/software/src-highlite/source-highlight.html).

NOTE that on cygwin the PDF generation does not work due to some error
in the cygwin port of 'fop' (Apache's Formatting Object
Processor). You can use Apache's binary distribution and use the
Windows fop.bat for the fop-step manually. thoni56/2014-04-06
