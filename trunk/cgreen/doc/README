HOW-TO:  Compiling the Cgreen Guide
======================================

This Cgreen Guide Book is written in DocBook 5.0.

The goal of this document is to give simple instructions to anyone who
wants to compile this book into a useful format, like HTML or PDF.  It
should state *exactly* which tools to use, and how to invoke them, in
simplest terms.

Table of Contents:

  I. PRIMER
 II. COMPILING THE DOCS
III. HACKING ON THE DOCS

I. PRIMER

  DocBook has a tortured, confusing history.  Before you do anything,
  take a look at Eric Raymond's excellent "DocBook Demystification HOWTO":

     http://tldp.org/HOWTO/DocBook-Demystification-HOWTO/

  It's very short and clears up many things.

II. COMPILING THE DOCS


1. Fetch XSL stylesheets for DocBook and place them in doc/tools/xsl.

   The "DocBook Open Repository" on Sourceforge has a large collection
   of XSL stylesheets that specifically operate on DocBook.  Download
   and install the latest 'docbook-xsl-ns' package from this page:
  
      http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=21935

   Download the latest version of docbook-xsl-ns, unpack it, then rename
   the unpacked directory to doc/tools/xsl, something like this:

      $ cd tools
      $ tar zxvf docbook-xsl-X.YY.Z.tar.gz
      $ mv docbook-xsl-ns-X.YY.Z xsl

   The default build process expects to the stylesheets to be in
   doc/tools/xsl/.

2. Fetch the DocBook 5 and place them in doc/tools/docbook.
   
   Download the latest version of docbook, unpack it, then rename
   the unpacked directory to doc/tools/docbook-5.0, something like this:
      
      $ cd tools
      $ wget http://www.docbook.org/xml/5.0/docbook-5.0.zip
      $ unzip docbook-5.0.zip

   The default build process expects to the DocBook to be in
   doc/tools/docbook-5.0/.
   
3. Use XSLT to transform the book.

   XSLT applies an .xsl stylesheet to an .xml file, and produces some
   new markup document.

   * Get libxslt, a C library for XSLT, from http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/.
     (If you're having trouble finding a source package to compile,
     try ftp://archive.progeny.com/GNOME/sources/libxslt/1.0/.)
     Install it:

        $ tar zxvf libxslt-1.0.22.tar.gz
        $ cd libxslt-1.0.22
        $ ./configure
        $ ./make
        # make install

     (Note: you may discover that you need to install libxml2 first.
     Find it at ftp://archive.progeny.com/GNOME/sources/libxml2/)

     If you don't want to compile libxslt, you can just fetch the
     appropriate OS binary package.  

   * From this directory (en, or another language directory), do 

        $ make html

     This produces a single-page HTML version of the book in
     doc/cgreen-guide/cgreen-guide-en.html.

         
4. Make a PDF file.

   Formatting Objects (FO) is a layout language, kind of like
   postscript, dvi or css.  People are quickly standardizing on it.

   * Fetch FOP, a java program which converts .fo files into PDF:

        http://xml.apache.org/fop/index.html

     There are approximately 17577 ways to install FOP.  Rather than
     describe them all, we will recommend one way.  If you've already
     installed FOP some other way, that's fine, then you can ignore
     the following recipe:

        1. Download the latest version from 
           http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/xml/fop, for example,
           fop-0.20.5-bin.tar.gz.  Just get a binary distribution,
           there's no need for the Java source.

        2. Unpack it into src/tools/fop/

           $ cd doc/tools
           $ tar zxvf fop-0.20.5-bin.tar.gz
           $ mv fop-0.20.5 fop

     Of course, to run FOP at all, you also need a Java runtime
     environment.  Try java.sun.com or www.blackdown.org if you don't
     already have that.

     Sometimes building the book can use more memory than Java is
     willing to allocate by default, and you may need to increase the
     default heap size.  With Sun's JVM, this is accomplished by
     passing the arguments "-Xms100m -Xmx200m" (known to work with
     versions 1.2.x-1.4.x, and likely different for JVMs from other
     vendors).  To tell fop.sh about these arguments, pass them via
     the environment variable FOP_OPTS (which is also configurable in
     your ~/.foprc).

        $ export FOP_OPTS="-Xms100m -Xmx200m"

   * If you want images to be included in the PDF, you'll need to use
     the JIMI image processing library.  Grab the latest release from
     http://java.sun.com/products/jimi/, then cp the jar file into the
     same place as the FOP jar files:

        $ cd doc/tools
        $ tar zxvf jimi1_0.tar.Z
        $ cp Jimi/examples/AppletDemo/JimiProClasses.jar fop/lib/

     Poof!  You now have PNG support.

   * From the directory doc/, do 

        $ make pdf

     This produces PDF for the book in doc/cgreen-guide-en.pdf.


III. HACKING ON THE DOCS

In addition to everything in section II:

1. Get a validating parser.

   Actually, if you have what you need to compile the documentation,
   then you almost certainly have an XML validator installed already -
   it is called xmllint, and comes as part of libxml2.

   The makefile is preconfigured with a suitable invocation of it,
   so simply run:
   
      $ make valid


2. Read about DocBook.

   You'll want to get real intimate with a DocBook reference, such as
   can be found at:  http://www.docbook.org/tdg/en/html/
