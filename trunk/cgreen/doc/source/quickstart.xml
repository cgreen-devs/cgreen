                Cgreen is a unit tester for the C software developer.
            </p>
			<p>
				Unit testing is a development practice popularised by the
				agile development community.
				It is characterised by writing many small tests alongside
				the normal code.
				Often the tests are written before the code they are testing,
				in a tight test-code-refactor loop.
				Done this way, the practice is known as Test Driven Development.
			</p>
			<p>
				Unit tests are written in the same language as the code, in
				our case C.
				This avoids the mental challenge of constantly switching language,
				and also allows you to use any application code in your tests.
			</p>
			<p>
				Cgreen fully supports this style of working.
