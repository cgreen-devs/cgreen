HOW-TO:  Compiling the Cgreen Project
======================================

This file talk about the build process used in Cgreen project. The intention
is to prove basic information for two distinct users groups: the users of
Cgreen Unit test framework and to the developers. Cgreen is a singular project
because it can be inserted in other project which use unit tests.

We have two ways to use Cgreen:

The first way to use is build the simple Makefile. You can see the Makefile on
the decompressed folder (you need to run the make command to build the project).
Within the ./contrib directory there are examples some to explain others build tool. 
These files are there because you can use to build Cgreen with others way.

Remember: the work to insert and get it work inside of owns project is your. We just
provide a simple way to use Cgreen. Keep in mind to retain the things simple and 
you can update the Cgreen sources when necessary.

The second way to use is just recommend for the Cgreen developers. If you need to do:
distribuition packages, build the docs, run regression tests or developer some feature,
then it is necessary to use this second way.

We are using the CMake (www.cmake.org) build system. Following we will
demonstrate a typical session. It is know as out-of-source building. Because we will
build all the project outside of the sources directory.

Decompress the sources:
    $ tar cgreen-1.0.0.tar.gz
Make the build directory:
    $ mkdir cgreen-build
    $ cd cgreen-build
Within the directory, we create the Makefile
    $ cmake ../cgreen
Following we can use some rules to do some works:
    $make
    $make test
    $make packages
To build docs, first read the file docs/README, run:
    $ cmake ../cgreen -DENABLE_DOCS=1
    $make pdf
    $make html
To build the html website:
    $ cmake ../cgreen -DENABLE_WEBSITE=1
    $ make bundled-html

The majority of the users will choice the first option. If you choice the second way, 
you must have the cmake tool instaled in your system.
