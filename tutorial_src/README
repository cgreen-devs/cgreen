This directory contains source files and output for the examples in
the tutorial documentataion. You should run these now and then and
make sure that they compile and work.

Note however that the guide includes specific lines from certain of
these files, so if you change anything you need to be certain that the
guide is still correct.

On the other hand we will always know that the code in the guide
actually works and is correct.

You need mysql client header files to make some sources to compile.
