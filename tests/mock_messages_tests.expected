mock_messages_tests.c: Failure: Mocks -> failure_reported_when_expect_after_always_expect_for_same_function 
	Mocked function [integer_out] already has an expectation that it will always be called a certain way; any expectations declared after an always expectation are invalid

mock_messages_tests.c: Failure: Mocks -> failure_reported_when_expect_after_never_expect_for_same_function 
	Mocked function [integer_out] already has an expectation that it will never be called; any expectations declared after a never call expectation are invalid

mock_messages_tests.c: Failure: Mocks -> reports_always_expect_after_never_expect_for_same_function 
	Mocked function [integer_out] already has an expectation that it will never be called; any expectations declared after a never call expectation are discarded

	Mocked function [integer_out] already has an expectation and will always be called a certain way; any expectations declared after an always expectation are discarded

mock_messages_tests.c: Failure: Mocks -> reports_multiple_never_expect 
	Mocked function [integer_out] already has an expectation that it will never be called; declaring an expectation for a function after a never call expectation is not allowed
